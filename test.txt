the wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
hands down my favorite italian restaurant!	1
shrimp- when i unwrapped it (i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
no complaints!	1
worst thai ever.	0
we got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
ryan's bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i won't be revisiting.	0
i've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from jenni pho.	0
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
i love this place.	1

do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
food was really good and i got full petty fast.	1
i'm super pissd.	0
the crãªpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
i've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0

good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0

nothing special.	0

the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
there was hardly any meat.	0

not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... mmmm...!	1
i've had better atmosphere.	0
this place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
hawaiian breeze, mango magic, and pineapple delight are the smoothies that i've tried so far and they're all good.	1
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten.	0
i ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
very bad experience!	0
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
don't waste your time here.	0
overall, i don't think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too.	0
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
go to place for gyros.	1
service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	1
it was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0

it's not hard to make a decent hamburger.	0

an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
i can't tell you how disappointed i was.	0
the service was outshining & i definitely recommend the halibut.	1
they were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.	1
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
anyway, i do not think i will go back there.	0
will go back next trip out.	1
service was very prompt.	1
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
i'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
so good i am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
there is nothing authentic about this place.	0
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0

i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
i've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
a fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
not good for the money.	0
i love this place.	1
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
a great way to finish a great.	1

the menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0

phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
honeslty it didn't taste that fresh.)	0
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
the staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again .	1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional hunan style".	0
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
service was fantastic.	1
avoid at all cost!	0
we waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
the worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
by this point, my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
i gave it 5 stars then, and i'm giving it 5 stars now.	1
the service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
to summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
this place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
waiter was a jerk.	0
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
i got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
when i'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot i'll hit up again!	1
the service was meh.	0
special thanks to dylan t. for the recommendation on what to order :) all yummy for my tummy.	1
same evening, him and i are both drastically sick.	0
i've never been treated so bad.	0
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
will be back again!	1
the chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
you cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated.	0
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers, but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place.	0
i personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and baba ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well, and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
i started this review with two stars, but i'm editing it to give it only one.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic.	1
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
overall, i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon.	0
loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
the service was extremely slow.	0
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
the block was amazing.	1
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
it is perfect for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc.	1
it kept getting worse and worse so now i'm officially done.	0
the potato chip order was sad... i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
we've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
an absolute must visit!	1
that just screams "legit" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in vegas.	1
i don't each much pasta, but i love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1
not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
all the bread is made in-house!	1
i dont think i will be back for a very long time.	0
highly recommended.	1
pretty awesome place.	1
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but i'm not inspired to go back.	0
boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
the live music on fridays totally blows.	0
frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
